# Product brief

Give a father and son an enjoyable competitive game while apart, with invited friends and an ongoing leaderboard. Easy joining, responsive phone and desktop play, and short repeatable matches are the priorities.

## Approved starting design

- Third-person, over-the-shoulder camera; no building.
- Browser delivery on phones and desktops, touch and keyboard/mouse.
- Private 2–8 player free-for-all, five minutes or first to 15 eliminations.
- Three-second respawns with full starting loadout, 100 health, and 50 shield.
- Two-second spawn protection, ending on weapon fire.
- Slot 1 AR, slot 2 shotgun, slot 3 two healing charges per life.
- Each heal restores 50 health after three seconds. Damage or weapon fire interrupts it; activated charges are consumed.
- Crew ratings, wins, matches, eliminations, deaths, win rate, monthly/all-time standings, five-match placements, and match history.
- Rematches and clear waiting, connection, and error states.
- Original Blender-created rigged models with human proportions and believable movement. Current armor is stylized; motion is hand-keyed.

## Current content

Sunbreak Courtyard is a sunny coastal arena with shared collision, cover, stepped elevation, and multiple routes. The AR has a 30-round magazine and the shotgun six rounds; both have unlimited reserve and server-controlled reloads. Everyone receives the same equipment.

Casual games never affect ratings. A solo practice range provides stationary training drones; it is not an AI-opponent mode.

## Remote play

Both clients connect outward to one hosted server over HTTPS/WSS without household router port forwarding. The server owns membership, movement validation, weapons, health, scores, and results. Room invitations expire; friend-crew membership controls ranked games and leaderboard access.

## Deferred scope

Public matchmaking, shrinking battle-royale arenas, additional weapons/maps, AI opponents, voice/chat, progression, purchases, controller support, and console clients are outside this first build.

## Success

Both intended players join from different homes on their actual devices, complete a match, see consistent results and correct leaderboard changes, and rematch without developer assistance. Local automated testing does not substitute for that family playtest.
